# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project performs **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** on the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** using **Python** and **pandas**, and includes six tasks to understand customer churn behavior.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is:
`Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.csv`
---

## ✅ Tasks Performed

### **Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

* Removed or filled missing/null values.
* Converted columns to appropriate datatypes.
* Cleaned `TotalCharges` column.
* Result: Clean dataset ready for analysis.

### **Task 2: Churn Rate Analysis**

* Calculated churn percentage for churned vs non-churned customers.
* Visualized churn distribution using bar plot.

### **Task 3: Service Usage vs Churn**

* Analyzed how services like `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `TechSupport`, etc., affect churn.
* Used grouped bar plots for visual representation.

### **Task 4: Tenure Analysis**

* Studied customer churn with respect to `tenure` groups.
* Created custom bins and visualized the impact.

### **Task 5: Monthly Charges vs Churn**

* Compared average `MonthlyCharges` for churned and non-churned users.
* Displayed comparison using box plot.

### **Task 6: Contract Type Impact**

* Analyzed effect of `Contract` type on churn rate.
* Plotted churn rates for `Month-to-month`, `One year`, and `Two year`.
